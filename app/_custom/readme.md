# Custom site documentation

## Getting started

-  Install pnpm (https://pnpm.io/installation))
-  Copy `.env.example` to `.env` then request the values from a core team member on Discord. These variables will connect you to the development database https\://manatee.wiki

## Collections

-  Collections are created in the `app/_custom/collections` directory.
-  Mana utilizes Payload to create custom collection types for your site. You can read more about collections in the Payload documentation (https://payloadcms.com/docs/collections).

## Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run `pnpm dev` from the root of the directory. This will start the express server that serves both the Remix and Payload application.
